              <p>
                Hello! My name is <b>David Bishop</b>, nice to meet you.
                Currently, I am <b>20</b> years of age and I'm a fresh graduate
                from my Software Development course at Keyin College where we
                learned about several different coding languages; Python,
                Javascript, Java, NodeJS, Sql, etc. The course really gives you
                an insight into the tech field and a feel of what's to come. We
                learned about full-stack and that is what I will strive to be, a
                full-stack developer. I found love and passion in making
                full-stack applications especially <b>designing</b> them. I
                think I have a natural knack for design, ever since I was a kid
                I thought I was creative. I also think I have the ability to be
                a leader, I set up all the projects for the team of our sprint
                projects at school. I have knowledge of agile principles, I was
                basically the scrum master. On a side note, I'm also interested
                in learning mobile development, not just web, but that's not on
                my schedule right now. Basically, I want to be able to code
                through the development lifecycle, although I am interested in
                the designing phase. Currently, learning more about ReactJS, I'm
                really interested in developing with React, and a back-end
                language; Java. Check out my GitHub if you have the time, it has
                many projects -{" "}

              <p>
                Personally, I am a pretty chill guy, a humble genuine dude
                really. I like playing video games in my spare time, just like a
                nerd should. I love basketball, I played it in high school, I
                did with a lot of sports like, of course, hockey. I have been
                skateboarding when it is warmer now too, but mostly I just code
                until it gets late or something. I was always tech-savvy growing
                up, everyone would ask me things about computers. That's what
                ultimately brought me to here and my creativity will hopefully
                lead the way, I'm always thinking of something.

                Ah yes, the projects tab up there is some of my smaller
                projects, they have their own GitHub repository, but I wanted to
                feature them on my Portfolio. Feel free to take a look, they're
                probably not too exciting, but I worked very hard on them and I
                think they are impressive for the level I'm currently at. I hope
                you can like them too and be inspired!
