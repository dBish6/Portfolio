                  Hello! My name is <b>David Bishop</b>, nice to meet you.
                  Currently, I am <b>20</b> years of age and I am a recent
                  graduate from the Software Development course at Keyin College
                  in 2022. During my time at Keyin College, I learned several
                  different coding languages, including Javascript, Java,
                  NodeJS, SQL, and more. From a young age, I've always
                  considered myself a <b>creative</b> person, and that has led
                  me to find passion in <b>full-stack</b> development. I found
                  love and passion in <b>designing</b> and creating full-stack
                  applications, and I believe that I have a natural knack for
                  designing these applications. This love for creating and
                  designing software has only grown since I started my learning
                  journey, and I'm <b>eager</b> to continue exploring and
                  expanding my skills in this area. I am always brewing up some
                  idea into fruition and the quality only gets better and
                  better, I learn by doing. I have uploaded my applications on
                  GitHub, and I would be thrilled if you could take at them.

                  Personally, I am a pretty chill guy, a humble genuine dude
                  really. I like playing video games in my spare time, just like
                  a nerd should. I love basketball, I played it in high school,
                  I did with a lot of sports like, of course, hockey. I have
                  been skateboarding when it is warmer now too, but mostly I
                  just code until it gets late or something. I was always
                  tech-savvy growing up, everyone would ask me things about
                  computers. That's what ultimately brought me to here and my
                  creativity will hopefully lead the way, I'm always thinking of
                  something.

                  Ah yes, the projects tab up there is some of my other projects
                  or a project from one of my bigger applications, they have
                  their own GitHub repository, but I wanted to feature them on
                  my Portfolio. It also shows my progress because it goes from
                  early to new, the first link on top is the earliest. So, feel
                  free to take a look, the earliest ones are probably not too
                  exciting, but I worked very hard on them and I think it is
                  impressive by showing how much I grown. I hope you like them
                  and get inspired by my work!
