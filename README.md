# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website where you can learn more about me and my journey as a software developer. I have come a long way since graduating from my software course in 2022 and I'm excited to share my progress with you!

If you're interested in hiring me or collaborating on any of my projects, feel free to contact me at [davidbish2002@hotmail.com](mailto:davidbish2002@hotmail.com).

### portfolio_v1
My first portfolio version was created early in my coding journey and while it may be basic, it was a great starting point for me. You can check it out and see how much I have improved since then, in "Releases" located in this repository.

### portfolio_v2
The second version of my portfolio, which is the one you would want to look at. This also shows how much I have improved compared to the first version. This version improves everything by a long shot and uses a custom 12 column grid layout in css that I have been learning, first time I used it here. This portfolio has a more refined and visually appealing design. Take a look and see how much progress I've made since the first version of my portfolio!

### portfolio_v3 - *Coming Soon*
Is currently in the ideate design phase!
