# Portfolio

This is my portfolio, a website that's all about me! I am still a new developer, but this portfolio is better then any new developer's:) I worked very hard on it, if you take a look at it, I hope you like it and get inspired!

### portfolio_v1
The first version of my portfolio is pretty basic. I made it early in my coding journey so of course it would be, but it is still good for a start.

### portfolio_v2
This is the second version of my portfolio, which is the one you would want to look at. This also shows how much I have improved compared to the first version. This version improves everything by a long shot and uses a custom 12 column grid layout in css that I have been learning, first time I used it here.

**Deployed Stable Version of the Website**<br />
