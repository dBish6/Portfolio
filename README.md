# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website where you can learn more about me and my journey as a software developer. I have come a long way since graduating from my software course in 2022 and I'm excited to share my progress with you!

If you're interested in hiring me or collaborating on any of my projects, feel free to contact me at [davidbish2002@hotmail.com](mailto:davidbish2002@hotmail.com).

### portfolio_v1

My first portfolio version was created early in my coding journey and while it may be basic, it was a great starting point for me. You can check it out and see how much I have improved since then, in "Releases" located in this repository.
